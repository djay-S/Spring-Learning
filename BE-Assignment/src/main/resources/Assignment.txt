Design backend APIs which showcase the following actions in POSTMAN via a sequence of API calls.

1. A student A enters his university ID number and pswd and gets a unique token(pick a code generated uuid for now) back which is used in authentication in all further APIs for this user - sent as bearer token in the headers.
2. A sees a list of free sessions available with the dean. Each dean slot is 1 hr long and dean is only available on Thur, Fri 10 AM every week.
3. A picks one of the above slots and books.
4. Dean logins in with his university ID and pswd (similar to 1 above). Yes Dean too gets his own token.
5. Dean sees a list of all pending sessions - student name, and slot details. Currently only A.
6. Student B logs in, gets a list of free slots and books a slot.
7. Dean logs in back and sees a list of his pending sessions - both A and B.
8. Dean logs in back after slot time booked by A and he can see only B in the list. (You can simulate this by manually changing the start slot time that A booked to a past time. Yes thts is a DB manual edit)

Submission Guidelines -
Share the video to vamsee@ratham.in , harsh@ratham.in, kalpit@ratham.in, ananya@ratham.in

that shows
1. the postman demo,
2. explains the code base, database structures
3. All actual data in DB that got inserted after the above demo

Instructions -
Choose any language or DB that you seem apt
All APIs except login APIs must take uuid bearer token that is validated in BE
In the postman demo, show that a wrong uuid authentication will make an API fail
If you don't understand the bearer token or authentication concept, google it. It is easy to understand.
There could be multiple deans in the college with their available free weekly schedule
